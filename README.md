# dotfiles - @humbertowoody

This repository holds all my personal dotfiles configuration and a compendium
of setup-tooling in order to get everything were it's supposed to be.

## Automagic

In order to setup everything I use a `Makefile` with a bunch of different
options and with built-in _pretty_ documentation.

````sh
make           # shows help
make help      # wow so much help
make symlinks  # setup the symlinks
make setup     # run .sh on scripts/setup/*
make 
````

## Credits + Acknowledgments

Honestly, handling dotfiles has been a *nightmare* over the years, for the
ocassion of (finally) picking a strategy and did my research, if you'd 
like to see the original inspiration for this:
